PHOTO REQUIREMENTS:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Recommended size: 300x300 pixels (minimum 240x240)
- Aspect ratio: Square (1:1) works best
- Quality: High quality, clear headshot

WHAT TO EXPECT:
- The photo will appear in a rounded square with subtle shadow
- It will have a white border effect
- It will fade in with animation when the page loads
- It will be responsive on mobile devices

YOUR PHOTO IS ALREADY CONFIGURED IN:
- index.html (uses <img src="assets/profile.jpg">)

Just save your photo as "profile.jpg" in this folder and you're done!
